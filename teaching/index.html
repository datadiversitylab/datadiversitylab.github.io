                Welcome to the teaching section at the data diversity lab. Our commitment to teaching extends beyond the classroom, aiming to equip students with the tools to ask meaningful questions and navigate the complexities of scientific inquiry. In the courses that we teach, we go beyond the textbook, fostering an environment where students gain skills that transcend the boundaries of academia. We are primarily interested in implementing the following four key teaching principles in the classes that we are involved in:

                Below are the answers to three short questions from teaching course evaluations for multiple courses that Dr. Román-Palacios taught between 2016 (the first year in the US*) and 2019. No TCEs were available during 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Only comments concerning Dr. Román-Palacios’ performance as an instructor are available. No comments were filtered out, and students' identities are completely anonymous, even to me! We will be curating TCEs for 2021+ in future years.

<p>2019 - My TA is very good and knows what he is teaching. It is evident that he loves Ecol!</p>
<p>2019 - The TA is amazing</p>

<p>2017 - This is my first science lab I've taken in college and it has been okay. The TA is a hard grader so I am not always happy with my grades. The TA is very nice and cares about the students.</p>
<p>2017 - We were allotted enough time to complete lab assignments in class. Assignments were clear, as well as labs and directions. If there were any questions, confusion, etc., I felt comfortable asking Cristian.</p>

                                <p>2019 - I think one suggestion is that his voice is a bit low and a bit fast. Therefore, I think he should slow down a bit in the lecture portion and engage students a bit more in interactive activities.</p>
<p>2019 - slow down when going through the slideshow, don't call students out post-presentation...</p>
<p>2018 - Cristine needs to practice speaking clearer when he is flustered/excited. It was just hard to understand him.</p>
<p>2018 - grading criteria changes &amp; is unclear. cannot understand TA's accent. Lack of English proficiency makes his explanations confusing, i.e. TA: &quot;there are petidoglycan in that tissue sample&quot; Me: &quot;so there are multiple peptidoglycan?&quot; TA: &quot;no there is only one&quot; See how improper grammar causes his explanations to be incorrect and misleading?</p>
<p>2017 - I do not think any changes need to be made; this lab was excellent!</p>
<p>2016 - Grading was fair in the begging, then out of nowhere it changed to harsh grading without notice. Therefore, I would suggest making grading less harsh and more fair.</p>
<p>2016 - The TA did a great job, but a lot of the procedures in the lab manual just didn't feel important. A lot of the sections felt like busy work. I don't have a great way to improve this, but I would try to incorporate some kind of feedback where students are asked which lab section specifically didn't work and which ones worked well.</p>

                                <p>2019 - An enjoyable environment, with medium stress.</p>
<p>2019 - Cristian made lab enjoyable and kinda fun, made the presentations in lab engaging</p>
<p>2019 - Cristian was a very good lab TA. I appreciate that he was so helpful in class. My one criticism would be to talk louder when lecturing because sometimes it was difficult to hear.</p>
<p>2019 - Cristian was really great at helping when I was confused though was sometimes hard to understand.</p>
<p>2019 - I liked Cristian as an instructor.</p>
<p>2019 - I think he's a great TA!</p>
<p>2019 - Thank you</p>
<p>2019 - Christian is the best TA even.</p>
<p>2019 - Cristian is great!</p>
<p>2019 - Cristian is the best, he helped my lab partners and I whenever we needed it and was always very patient with us</p>
<p>2019 - Good instructor and very helpful.</p>
<p>2019 - Have a good summer vacation (if you have one).</p>
<p>2019 - This TA was very caring and passionate about the subject which made the lab overall more enjoyable.</p>
<p>2019 - This TA was very helpful in lab.</p>
<p>2018 - Cristian was a very good lab TA.</p>
<p>2018 - Great TA. One of the best I've had so far. Glad I had the opportunity to take Ecol Lab with Christian.</p>
<p>2018 - Cristian has made my lab experience a positive one. I didnt find that any of the other lab sections were happy with their instructors as much as our section.</p>
<p>2018 - Cristian was a good TA and was always willing to help me on an individual basis.</p>
<p>2018 - Cristian was one of the best, if not the best TA I've had at the UofA. He knew the topic completely, always explained topics in depth, and always answered questions completely.</p>
<p>2018 - I really liked the way this lab was organized. I knew what was expected of me and I felt good about the material when I went over a project.</p>
<p>2018 - The instructor was very hard to understand while lecturing to the class</p>
<p>2017 - Christian was great, but really hard to understand. I would almost always have to go through his lecture slides after class because I would have no idea what we learned in class.</p>
<p>2017 - Christian was a great teacher, very kind and respectful, he always explained things in different ways to make sure everyone understood and was always patient in explaining concepts to people and kept trying until they understood it. I think he was a hard grader though for reports.</p>
<p>2017 - it was unfortunate, but it was very hard to understand this TA due to the accent.</p>
<p>2017 - The TA did a great job teaching this section to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>2016 - I liked my instructor, but I did not enjoy the class</p>
<p>2016 - the teacher was great and the overall structure of the class was great as well</p>
<p>2016 - Cristian is a really knowledgeable TA. There is a small language barrier, but he was able to convey his lessons to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>2016 - Cristian is a wonderful person - very nice, very easy to talk to, but does not speak enough english to be teaching a course. I know that he was always trying to help us, but it was not adequate or on topic when he tried. It is a lose-lose situation because I'm sure he is uncomfortable when we ask questions he cannot understand or answer. However, he did always try.</p>
<p>2016 - Cristian is very intelligent, that much is clear. But his lack of communication with students hurts the lab significantly. The way that assignments were graded didn't really seem to fit with rubrics on some occasions, and because of that students did not really know what was expected of them. There was a lot of trial and error that resulted in poorer grades in the beginning of the semester, which certainly could have been avoided. I do not think he was the right choice to being teaching a lab.</p>
<p>2016 - great TA</p>
<p>2016 - Instructor has a very thick accent and can be hard to understand but is willing to take the time to help you understand.</p>
