DateSeason: January 2025
Description: Jhan proudly presented his first-ever poster at a conference during
  SICB 2025 (the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology), showcasing
  his research on physiological specialization in Anolis lizards across
  elevations in the Andes. The poster highlighted how thermal limits drive
  adaptive radiation and endemism in these Andean tropical lizards. He had the
  opportunity to engage with attendees, answer questions, and discuss the
  broader implications of his work. Jhan is grateful for the insightful
  conversations and the chance to share his passion for understanding
  evolutionary patterns in these fascinating reptiles.
