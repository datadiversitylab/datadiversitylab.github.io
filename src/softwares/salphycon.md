Name: Salphycon
Description: Salphycon is a shiny app that extends the functionalities of the
  (phruta) R package. Salphycon is able to (1) find potentially
  (phylogenetically) relevant gene regions for a given set of taxa on GenBank,
  (2) retrieve gene sequences and curate taxonomic information from the same
  database, (3) combine downloaded and local gene sequences, and (4) perform
  sequence alignment, phylogenetic inference, and basic tree dating tasks. Both
  phruta and salphycon are focused on species-level analyses.
