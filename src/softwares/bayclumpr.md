Name: bayclumpr
Description: To support the use of Bayesian models and the analytical framework
  developed in Rom√°n-Palacios et al. (2022) for clumped isotope calibration and
  for temperature reconstructions, and to facilitate comparisons of Bayesian and
  classical models, we present a self-contained R package and associated Shiny
  Dashboard application, bayclumpr and BayClump, respectively. bayclumpr (and
  BayClump) fits both frequentist and Bayesian linear regressions to calibration
  datasets and performs temperature reconstructions under both frameworks.
