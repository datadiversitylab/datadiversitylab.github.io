Description: bayclumpr is a self-contained R package that supports the use of
  Bayesian models and the analytical framework developed in Román-Palacios et
  al. (2022) for clumped isotope calibration, temperature reconstructions, and
  facilitatation of comparisons on Bayesian and classical models. bayclumpr fits
  both frequentist and Bayesian linear regressions to calibration datasets and
  performs temperature reconstructions under both frameworks.
