Name: CityComp
Description: CityComp is a Shiny app developed to support the use of the
  comparative framework developed in Arechiga et al. (2023). In the app, users
  can directly visualize the results presented in the same paper. Specifically,
  a graphical and interactive version of Fig. 6 in the same paper is presented
  in the app. Users can further define a target city and estimate their
  similarity to cities across the globe. Dynamic filtering and mapping are
  implemented within the app.
