Name: Santa Cruz E. coli Predictions
Description: This tool predicts *Escherichia coli (E. coli*) levels in the Upper
  Santa Cruz River using a model trained on public data from 2009-2022. It is
  intended as a warning of possible high bacterial loads; water quality must
  still be verified using coliform testing procedures to ensure public safety.
