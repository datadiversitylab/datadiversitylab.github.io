Description: BayClump is a Shiny Dashboard application that is associated with
  the bayclumpr R package. All the functions implemented in BayClump are sourced
  from bayclumpr. We eveloped BayClump to allow users with less coding
  experience to be able to access standarized resources to calibrate and derive
  reconstructions using clumped isotope datasets.
