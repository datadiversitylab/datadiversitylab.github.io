Name: phruta
Description: The phruta R package is designed to simplify the basic phylogenetic
  pipeline. All the code is run within the same program and data from
  intermediate steps are saved in independent folders (optional). phruta
  retrieves gene sequences, combines newly downloaded to local gene sequences,
  performs sequence alignments, and basic phylogenetic inference.
