Description: Enhannced PPE2 is a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) tailored for
  real-time object detection, with a specific focus on hard hat compliance
  monitoring in industrial settings. Although this project is tailored for hard
  hat compliance monitoring, the modular architecture allows easy adaptation for
  other applications like gengeral PPE detection including masks, goggles, vest
  and so on. This project focuses on developing the UI associated to the ML
  model detection algorithm.
