Description: "Bayesian Additive Regression Networks. We apply Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) principles to training an ensemble of small neural networks for regression tasks. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Bayesian Additive Regression Net- works (BARN) samples from the space of single hidden layer neural networks that are conditioned on their fit to data. You can find more information in [barnpy](https://github.com/dvbuntu/barmpy) and its associated [documentation](https://dvbuntu.github.io/barmpy/)"
