Name: BarrioMap
Description: Barrio Map offers fundamental functionalities like finding
  locations by conducting searches or selecting coordinates. Users can select
  from predefined scales and export the scaled maps to particular page sizes.
  Maps generated using Barrio Map are formal descriptions of particular sites
  with defined values of resolution, scales, and explicit information on
  distances. Barrio Map, in conjunction with OpenStreetMaps, is written in R,
  with functionalities largely leveraged from packages such as Leaflet and
  Shiny.
