  MILLIONS of Earth's creatures are at risk of extinction by 2070 due to climate
  change, scientists have warned.

  A study found that a third of animal and plant species could be wiped from existence as temperatures soar across the globe. Researchers at the University of Arizona examined 538 species at 581 sites worldwide. They focussed on creatures and plants found at the same sites over a ten-year period or more. More than four in ten of the species studied have already gone extinct at one or more sites. After combining this data with predictions of Earth's future climate, scientists made a grim discovery.
