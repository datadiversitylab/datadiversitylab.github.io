newsDesc: One-third of all animal and plant species on the planet could face
  extinction by 2070 due to climate change, a new study warns. Researchers
  studied recent extinctions from climate change to estimate how many species
  would be lost over the next 50 years. Specifically, scientists from the
  University of Arizona studied data from 538 species at 581 sites around the
  world and focused on plant and animal species that were surveyed at the same
  sites over time, at least 10 years apart.
