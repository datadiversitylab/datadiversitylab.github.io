newsDesc: "Animal conservationists often move elephants between herds to improve
  biodiversity and group health, but what if the elephants don't speak the same
  language? Studies suggest that populations, even those living relatively close
  to one another, may speak in subtly different \"rumbles.\" What if those
  differences were more than noise? What if different dialects made it harder
  for new elephants to make friends, form alliances or even warn others of
  danger? The elephant language gap is just one example of a growing body of
  research examining a wide range of behavioral differences in wild animals –
  differences that may be cultural, not just biological. This could help answer
  countless questions: Why don't all elephants understand each other? Why do
  some chimpanzees master stone tools while others don't? How did rats
  specialize in eating pinecones? "
