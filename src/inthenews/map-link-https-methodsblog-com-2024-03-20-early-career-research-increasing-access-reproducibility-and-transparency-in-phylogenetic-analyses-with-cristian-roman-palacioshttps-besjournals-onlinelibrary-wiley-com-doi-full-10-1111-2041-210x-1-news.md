newsDesc: 'Robert May Prize (shortlisted): "I was born in the Colombian Andes
  (Armenia, Quindío) back in the 90s. I received my bachelor’s degree in Biology
  from Universidad del Valle, in Cali, Colombia, in 2015. I moved to the US in
  2016 to pursue a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
  of Arizona – a degree that I completed in Fall of 2020. Although my research
  interests seem to have changed over time, most of the time, my main focus has
  been on addressing long-standing questions and using methods for asking
  questions primarily in biology from novel perspectives."'
