newsDesc: A new study led by ecologists at the University of Arizona reveals the
  origins of diverse animal and plant species richness in terrestrial, ocean and
  freshwater habitats at a global scale. It also explores the possible causes of
  these richness patterns. Published in the journal Ecology Letters, the study
  was led by Cristian Román-Palacios, an assistant professor in the UArizona
  School of Information in the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and
  John J. Wiens, a professor in UArizona Department of Ecology and Evolutionary
  Biology in the College of Science. It was co-authored by Daniela Moraga-López,
