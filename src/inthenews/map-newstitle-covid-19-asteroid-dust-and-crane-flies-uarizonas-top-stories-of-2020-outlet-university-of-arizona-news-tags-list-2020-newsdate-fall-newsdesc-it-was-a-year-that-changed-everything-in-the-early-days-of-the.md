  It was a year that changed everything. In the early days of the COVID-19
  pandemic, the University of Arizona responded swiftly to the challenges
  presented by an unprecedented public health crisis. The entire Wildcat
  community – from virologists to public health experts to psychologists and
  everyone in between – contributed their time, energy and expertise to help the
  university and the nation with life-saving safety efforts and long-term
  mitigation strategies. In between, the world watched as UArizona researchers
  "tagged" an asteroid, explored previously unanswered questions about the Maya
  civilization and, yes, figured out what's up with all those crane flies.
