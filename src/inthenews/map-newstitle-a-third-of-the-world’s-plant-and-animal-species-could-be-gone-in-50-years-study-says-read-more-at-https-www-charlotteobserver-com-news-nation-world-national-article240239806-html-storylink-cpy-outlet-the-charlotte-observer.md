newsDesc: One-third of all plant and animal species on Earth could face
  extinction in the next 50 years, experts say. A new study from the University
  of Arizona predicts that one in three species of plants and animals could face
  extinction by 2070 because of climate change. Researchers used data from
  hundreds of species to produce their findings, EurekAlert! said in a news
  release. They looked at local extinctions that have happened and analyzed data
  from 538 species and 581 places around the world in the study published in the
  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
