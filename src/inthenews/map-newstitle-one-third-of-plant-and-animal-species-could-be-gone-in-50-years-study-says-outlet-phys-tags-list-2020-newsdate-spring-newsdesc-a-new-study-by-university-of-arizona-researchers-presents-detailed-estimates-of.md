newsDesc: A new study by University of Arizona researchers presents detailed
  estimates of global extinction from climate change by 2070. By combining
  information on recent extinctions from climate change, rates of species
  movement and different projections of future climate, they estimate that one
  in three species of plants and animals may face extinction. Their results are
  based on data from hundreds of plant and animal species surveyed around the
  globe.
