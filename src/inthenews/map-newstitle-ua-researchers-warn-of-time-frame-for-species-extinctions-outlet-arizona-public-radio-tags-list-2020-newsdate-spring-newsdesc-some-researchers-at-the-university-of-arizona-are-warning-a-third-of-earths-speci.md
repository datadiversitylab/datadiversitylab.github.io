newsDesc: Some researchers at the University of Arizona are warning a third of
  Earth's species are headed for extinction within 50 years. A study co-authored
  by UA ecology and evolutionary biologists John Wiens and Cristian
  Roman-Palacios estimates the rates of future extinctions from climate change
  data. They looked at local extinctions that have already happened based on
  repeated studies of plants and animals over time.
