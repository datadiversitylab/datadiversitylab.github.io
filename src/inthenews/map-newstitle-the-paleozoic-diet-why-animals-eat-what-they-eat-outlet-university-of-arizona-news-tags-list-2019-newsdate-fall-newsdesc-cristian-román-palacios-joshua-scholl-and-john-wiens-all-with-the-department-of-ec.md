newsDesc: Cristian Román-Palacios, Joshua Scholl and John Wiens, all with the
  Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the UA, scoured the
  literature for data on the dietary habits of more than a million animal
  species, from sponges to insects and spiders to housecats. A species was
  classified as carnivorous if it feeds on other animals, fungi or protists
  (single-celled eukaryotic organisms, many of which live on bacteria). Species
  were classified as herbivorous if they depend on land plants, algae or
  cyanobacteria for food, and omnivorous if they eat a mixture of carnivorous
  and herbivorous diets.
