newsDesc: There are several plausible pathways that could lead to plant and
  animal species extinction from climate change. Every species has evolved to
  exist within a certain ecological niche, but climate change leads to changes
  of temperature and average weather patterns. These changes can push climatic
  conditions outside of the species' niche, and ultimately render it extinct.
  Normally, species faced with changing conditions can either adapt in place
  through microevolution or move to another habitat with suitable conditions.
  However, the speed of recent climate change is very fast. Due to this rapid
  change, for example cold-blooded animals (a category which includes
  amphibians, reptiles and all invertebrates) may struggle to find a suitable
  habitat within 50 km of their current location at the end of this century (for
  a mid-range scenario of future global warming).
