newsDesc: Accurately predicting biodiversity loss from climate change requires a
  detailed understanding of what aspects of climate change cause extinctions,
  and what mechanisms may allow species to survive. A new study by University of
  Arizona researchers presents detailed estimates of global extinction from
  climate change by 2070. By combining information on recent extinctions from
  climate change, rates of species movement and different projections of future
  climate, they estimate that one in three species of plants and animals may
  face extinction. Their results are based on data from hundreds of plant and
  animal species surveyed around the globe.
