newsDesc: The ancestor of all animals was most likely a carnivore, according to
  a new study that examines animal diets dating back 800 million years. The
  research also finds that there are many more meat eaters out there than
  scientists would expect. To analyze how diets evolved across the animal
  kingdom, John Wiens, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in
  Tucson, and his colleagues compiled a data set of more than 1000 extant
  species. These included vertebrates from humans to ducks and nearly 140
  species of beetles, and encompassed detailed information about their eating
  habits. The researchers then created a phylogeny—a huge family tree—of all the
  creatures to determine what their ancestors likely ate.
