newsDesc: Using data from surveys that studied 538 animals, insects and plants
  from 581 sites across the globe, researchers John J. Wiens and Cristian
  Román-Palacios from the University of Arizona found that approximately one in
  three plant, insect and animal species could face extinction by 2070. However,
  things could be even worse if emissions continue to rise as rapidly as they
  have in recent decades.
