newsDesc: When ecologist Daniella Teixeira visited her bushfire-ravaged study
  site on Kangaroo Island, South Australia in February this year, the scale of
  the damage hit her hard. Teixeira, an ecologist at The University of
  Queensland, Australia, felt numb and deeply sad as she set foot among the
  blackened trees and melted nest boxes that were once home to the black glossy
  cockatoos she studied during her PhD. The fires had burnt through one-third of
  the island since they started in December 2019.
