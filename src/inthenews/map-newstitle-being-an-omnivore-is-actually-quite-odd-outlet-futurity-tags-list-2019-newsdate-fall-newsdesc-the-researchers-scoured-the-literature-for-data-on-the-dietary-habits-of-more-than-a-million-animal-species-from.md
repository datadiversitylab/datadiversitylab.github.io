newsDesc: The researchers scoured the literature for data on the dietary habits
  of more than a million animal species, from sponges to insects and spiders to
  house cats. They classified a species as carnivorous if it feeds on other
  animals, fungi, or protists (single-celled eukaryotic organisms, many of which
  live on bacteria). The researchers classified species as herbivorous if they
  depend on land plants, algae, or cyanobacteria for food, and omnivorous if
  they eat a mixture of carnivorous and herbivorous diets. The scientists then
  mapped the vast dataset of animal species and their dietary preferences onto
  an evolutionary tree built from DNA-sequence data to untangle the evolutionary
  relationships between them.
