publicationAbstract: Despite tropical species comprising nearly 60% of Psocidae
  species, previous studies examining the Psocidae phylogeny have undersampled
  tropical diversity (<40% species in trees). Here we discuss the systematics of
  the Psocidae based on the most comprehensive species-level sampling of the
  Psocidae. We infer the phylogenetic position of 43 previously unsampled
  Neotropical species in the Psocidae phylogeny. We find that Neotropical
  psocids are generally not closely related to morphologically similar taxa in
  the Holarctic region. Consequently, the monophyletic status for the major
  groups within Psocidae (subfamilies and tribes) is recovered only when
  Holarctic groups are sampled (7–10 of 11 higher-level groups are monophyletic)
  but violated when Neotropical species are also sampled in the tree (1 of 11
  higher-level groups are monophyletic). Our study pinpoints at the downfalls of
  simply extending taxonomic knowledge from lineages of a certain area (i.e.
  Holarctic) to inform diversity and evolution of lineages in other regions
  (i.e. Neotropics).
