publicationAbstract: The increasing uncertainty about the conservation status of
  the different biological groups emphasizes the importance of concentrating
  efforts on gathering diversity records. In Colombia, biological explorations
  have revealed priority areas for conservation, but the lack of information
  about topics as species distribution, restricts both the emphasis and
  efficiency of conservation efforts. In particular, Quindío department
  represents an important area of faunal interest due to its geographical
  position and climatic conditions. However, still lacks of basic information
  for an comprehensive discussion of local diversity. This works aims to
  summarize the information on richness, geographic distribution and diversity
  of the herpetofauna in the department. Published information from different
  bibliographic resources indicates that about 108 species of amphibians and
  reptiles (48 and 57 spp. respectively) coexist within the political
  boundaries. Among these, the genus Anolis and Pristimantis recorded the
  highest species diversity. Despite the reduced department’s size, the species
  that have been recorded exhibit remarkable ecological importance and also act
  as a reservoir of diversity regarding surrounding areas.
