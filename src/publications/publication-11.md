publicationAbstract: Understanding the mechanisms that underlie chromosome
  evolution could provide insights into the processes underpinning the origin,
  persistence and evolutionary tempo of lineages. Here, we present the first
  database of chromosome counts for animals (the Animal Chromosome Count
  database, ACC) summarizing chromosome numbers for ~15,000 species. We found
  remarkable a similarity in the distribution of chromosome counts between
  animals and flowering plants. Nevertheless, the similarity in the distribution
  of chromosome numbers between animals and plants is likely to be explained by
  different drivers. For instance, we found that while animals and flowering
  plants exhibit similar frequencies of speciation-related changes in chromosome
  number, plant speciation is more often related to changes in ploidy. By
  leveraging the largest data set of chromosome counts for animals, we describe
  a previously undocumented pattern across the Tree of Life—animals and
  flowering plants show remarkably similar distributions of haploid chromosome
  numbers.
