publicationAbstract: The anuran assemblages in three habitats (forest, lake and
  quarry) with different degrees of human disturbance present in a dry forest
  fragment in the Farm La Española, Guarinocito, Caldas, were compared.
  Extensive routes samplings were conducted using visual encounter surveys
  (VES), from which abundance and microhabitat use were recorded for each one of
  the species within the different habitats, and the record of environmental
  variables describing the sampling area such as temperature, relative humidity,
  and water ponds perimeter, was carried out. A total of 13 anurans species were
  found, among which Engystomops pustulosus recorded the most relative abundance
  with a catch rate of 5.16 individuals per hour. Significant differences were
  found in diversity between the studied habitats being lower in the forest
  where there were lower richness but better dominance. The rate of replacement
  of species between habitats was 71%, showing pond and quarry the greater
  similarity in anurofauna composition. The use of substrate by each species was
  different between habitats (χ2, p<0.05) and only two species (Leptodactylus
  fragilis and L. colombiensis) showed high variability in the modified
  habitats.
