publicationAbstract: "In a previous paper, we used simulations and empirical
  data to show that BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) can
  give misleading estimates of rates and rate shifts. In simulations, BAMM
  underestimated rate shifts across every tree analyzed, and assigned incorrect
  rates to most clades in most trees. In empirical analyses, BAMM behaved as
  expected from simulations, and assigned different rates to clades when clades
  were analyzed alone versus across the tree (i.e., with rate heterogeneity).
  Rabosky recently criticized our paper, focusing primarily on the idea that our
  comparison of BAMM to another approach (methodof-moments estimators of
  Magallon and Sanderson, or MS estimators) was unfair to BAMM. Here, we provide
  further evidence ´ that BAMM gives misleading rate estimates in empirical
  studies. We then describe how Rabosky’s rown method comparisons were either
  acknowledged as being problematic or were described inaccurately (to favor
  BAMM). Finally, we show that the MS estimators can perform well when rates
  vary over time, despite untested assertions that they require constant rates
  to be accurate. Many other methods are available for analyzing diversification
  rates: we argue that BAMM should be avoided for estimating both
  diversification rates and rate shifts."
