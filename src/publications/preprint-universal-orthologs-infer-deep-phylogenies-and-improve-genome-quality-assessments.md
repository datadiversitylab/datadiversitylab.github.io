publicationAbstract: Universal single-copy orthologs are the most conserved
  components of genomes. Although they are routinely used for studying
  evolutionary histories and assessing new assemblies, current methods do not
  incorporate information from available genomic data. Here, we first determine
  the influence of evolutionary history on universal gene content and find that
  across 11,098 genomes of plants, fungi, and animals comprising 2606 taxonomic
  groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages in terms
  of BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs) completeness.
  Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of duplicated
  orthologs, likely from ancestral whole genome duplication events. Secondly, we
  investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in broad BUSCO-derived
  phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543 tested, sites evolving at
  higher rates produce at most 23.84% more taxonomically concordant, and at
  least 46.15% less terminally variable phylogenies compared to lower-rate
  sites. We find that BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees have comparable
  accuracy and conclude that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments
  produce the most congruent and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show
  that undetected, yet pervasive BUSCO gene loss events lead to
  misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this, we filter a Curated
  set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false positives compared
  to the standard search and introduce novel methods for comparing assemblies
  using gene synteny. Overall, we highlight the importance of considering
  evolutionary histories during assembly evaluations and release the phyca
  software toolkit that reconstructs consistent phylogenies and offers more
  precise assembly assessments.
