publicationAbstract: Universal single-copy orthologs are the most conserved
  components of genomes. Although they are routinely used for studying
  evolutionary histories and assessing new assemblies, current methods do not
  incorporate information from available genomic data. Here, we first determine
  the influence of evolutionary history on universal gene content in plants,
  fungi and animals. We find that across 11,098 genomes comprising 2,606
  taxonomic groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages
  in terms of their BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs)
  completeness. Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of
  duplicated orthologs, likely as an artifact of whole genome duplication
  events. Secondly, we investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in
  BUSCO-derived whole-genome phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543
  tested, sites evolving at higher rates produce at most 23.84% more
  taxonomically concordant, and at least 46.15% less terminally variable
  phylogenies compared to lower-rate sites. We find topological differences
  between BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees to be marginal and conclude
  that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments produce the most congruent
  and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show that BUSCO misannotations can
  lead to misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this issue, we
  filter a Curated set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false
  positives compared to the standard BUSCO search and introduce novel methods
  for comparing assemblies using BUSCO synteny. Overall, we highlight the
  importance of considering evolutionary histories during assembly evaluations
  and release the phyca software toolkit that reconstructs consistent
  phylogenies and reports phylogenetically informed assembly assessments.
