publicationAbstract: Although variation in effect sizes and predicted values
  among studies of similar phenomena is inevitable, such variation far exceeds
  what might be produced by sampling error alone. One possible explanation for
  variation among results is differences among researchers in the decisions they
  make regarding statistical analyses. A growing array of studies has explored
  this analytical variability in different (mostly social science) fields, and
  has found substantial variability among results, despite analysts having the
  same data and research question. We implemented an analogous study in ecology
  and evolutionary biology, fields in which there have been no empirical
  exploration of the ]variation in effect sizes or model predictions generated
  by the analytical decisions of different researchers. We used two unpublished
  datasets, one from evolutionary ecology (blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, to
  compare sibling number and nestling growth) and one from conservation ecology
  (Eucalyptus, to compare grass cover and tree seedling recruitment), and the
  project leaders recruited analyst teams, comprising analysts, to investigate
  the answers to prespecified research questions. Analyses conducted by these
  teams yielded usable effects for the blue tit dataset, and usable effects for
  the Eucalyptus dataset. We found substantial heterogeneity among results for
  both datasets, although the patterns of variation differed between them. For
  the blue tit analyses, the average effect was convincingly negative, with less
  growth for nestlings living with more siblings, but there was near continuous
  variation in effect size from large negative effects to effects near zero, and
  even effects crossing the traditional threshold of statistical significance in
  the opposite direction. In contrast, the average relationship between grass
  cover and Eucalyptus seedling number was only slightly negative and not
  convincingly different from zero, and most effects ranged from weakly negative
  to weakly positive, with about a third of effects crossing the traditional
  threshold of significance in one direction or the other. However, there were
  also several striking outliers in the Eucalyptus dataset, with effects far
  from zero. For both datasets, we found substantial variation in the variable
  selection and random effects structures among analyses, as well as in the
  ratings of the analytical methods by peer reviewers, but we found no strong
  relationship between any of these we recommend viewing this manuscript in html
  format at https://egouldo.github.io/ManyAnalysts/ and deviation from the
  meta-analytic mean. In other words, analyses with results that were far from
  the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use
  random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those
  analyses that found results that were close to the mean. The existence of
  substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions
  about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published
  results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.
