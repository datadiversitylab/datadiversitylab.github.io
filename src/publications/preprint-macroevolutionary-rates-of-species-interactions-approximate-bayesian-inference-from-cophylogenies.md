publicationAbstract: "Understanding the macroevolutionary dynamics of species
  interactions such as parasitisms, commensalisms, and mutualisms is an
  important goal in evolutionary ecology. To this end, statistical inference
  from extant cophylogenetic systems holds immense potential. However, such
  inference cannot yet handle the speciation-extinction dynamics that occur
  simultaneously in the host and symbiont clades on the same timescale. Here we
  present an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach that, while taking
  into account host and symbiont extinction, infers rates of four types of
  speciation from a cophylogenetic system: (i) host speciation, (ii) symbiont
  speciation without host-switching, (iii) symbiont speciation with
  host-switching, and (iv) cospeciation. The new ABC approach relies on a novel
  design of summary statistics combining both size-based (i.e., tree sizes) and
  size-free summary statistics (i.e., the normalized distribution of Branch
  Length Differences - BLenD) of the cophylogeny. Convergence analyses show that
  the combined design of summary statistics outperforms size-based or size-free
  summary statistics alone - achieving satisfactory accuracy in detecting rate
  heterogeneity between the four types of speciation. Our ABC approach allows
  the user to infer the predominant mode of speciation within a given
  cophylogenetic system. The approach is demonstrated with an application to a
  cophylogenetic dataset of commensalism, in which beetles of one genus mimic
  those of another. In this system, we identify host speciation as the
  predominant process with the fastest rate (in events per unit time) among all
  four types of speciation (i.e., 4.3-5.1 times faster than the median among all
  four types of speciation). Understanding how and why different types of
  speciation may predominate in different cophylogenetic systems can have
  implications for various areas in ecology and evolution such as host
  conservatism, trait-driven diversification, pathogen spillover risk, and
  parasite extinction risk. This new approach highlights the need and potential
  for future efforts to compile time-calibrated cophylogenies."
