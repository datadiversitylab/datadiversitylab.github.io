publicationAbstract: "Six species of geckos in the genus Goniurosaurus have been
  recorded from Guangxi, China. Here we describe a new species, Goniurosaurus
  chengzheng sp. nov. The new species is similar to allied species from Guangxi,
  but unique in a combination of the following characters: (1) four body bands
  with three between limb insertions; (2) precloacal pores 20; (3) body color
  reddish- brown; (4) snout to eye distance: eye to ear distance < 1. We used
  the mitochondrial genes 16S and cytb to confirm the distinctiveness of the
  species and place it within a molecular phylogeny of Goniurosaurus. The type
  specimens are deposited in the Museum of Biology, East China Normal University
  (ECNU)."
