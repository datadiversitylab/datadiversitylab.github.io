publicationAbstract: "Elemental ratios in biogenic marine calcium carbonates are
  widely used in geobiology, environmental science, and paleoenvironmental
  reconstructions. It is generally accepted that the elemental abundance of
  biogenic marine carbonates reflects a combination of the abundance of that ion
  in seawater, the physical properties of seawater, the mineralogy of the
  biomineral, and the pathways and mechanisms of biomineralization. Here we
  report measurements of a suite of nine elemental ratios (Li/Ca, B/Ca, Na/Ca,
  Mg/Ca, Zn/Ca, Sr/Ca, Cd/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca) in 18 species of benthic marine
  invertebrates spanning a range of biogenic carbonate polymorph mineralogies
  (low-Mg calcite, high-Mg calcite, aragonite, mixed mineralogy) and of phyla
  (including Mollusca, Echinodermata, Arthropoda, Annelida, Cnidaria,
  Chlorophyta, and Rhodophyta) cultured at a single temperature (25◦C) and a
  range of pCO2 treatments (ca. 409, 606, 903, and 2856 ppm). This dataset was
  used to explore various controls over elemental partitioning in biogenic
  marine carbonates, including species-level and biomineralizationpathway-level
  controls, the influence of internal pH regulation compared to external pH
  changes, and biocalcification responses to changes in seawater carbonate
  chemistry. The dataset also enables exploration of broad scale phylogenetic
  patterns of elemental partitioning across calcifying species, exhibiting high
  phylogenetic signals estimated from both uni- and multivariate analyses of the
  elemental ratio data (univariate: λ = 0– 0.889; multivariate: λ = 0.895–0.99).
  Comparing partial R 2 values returned from nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic
  regression analyses echo the importance of and show Frontiers in Earth Science

  Elemental Ratios Recapitulate Phylogeny that phylogeny explains the elemental
  ratio data 1.4–59 times better than mineralogy in five out of nine of the
  elements analyzed. Therefore, the strong associations between biomineral
  elemental chemistry and species relatedness suggests mechanistic controls over
  element incorporation rooted in the evolution of biomineralization mechanisms"
