publicationAbstract: When carrying out modelling analysis using experimental
  data is important to obtain a measure of the relative fit of the each model as
  a primary selection criterion. In this sense, there are few studies based on
  multi-model selection techniques for the theoretical representation of data
  sets, so it is common to incur in a misinterpretation of the existing
  patterns, or even more, the incorrect extrapolation and prediction based on
  the wrong model. This paper is intended to evaluate in 40 datasets from
  various ecological published studies the effectiveness of the linear
  regression model designated by the authors by contrasting with six regression
  models using the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, and furthermore to
  discuss its implications on subsequent interpretations made. It was found that
  the linear regression model was successful only in 13.35% of the datasets (15%
  of datasets for AIC and 11.7% of datasets for BIC ), but in the other hand,
  the logarithmic model was the most successful model in 38.5% of the cases (35%
  of datasets for AIC and 41.1% of the datasets for BIC), casting doubts on the
  efficiency of the linear regression over other types of regression under
  biological data.
