publicationAbstract: "We investigated the phylogenetic relationships among seven
  of the ten Halobatinae genera (Heteroptera: Gerridae) based on COI+II, 16S
  rRNA, and 28S rRNA genes. Our analyses recovered monophyly of Halobatinae, and
  suggested paraphyly of Metrocorini caused by the position of Ventidius and
  Esakia. Since our phylogenies did not infer monophyly of the subgenus
  Halobates (s.str.) within Halobatini, we synonymized Austrobates and Halobates
  (Hilliella) with Halobates. We confirmed that (1) the limnic lifestyle of
  Metrocorini was ancestral in Halobatinae, (2) the marine lifestyle evolved
  only once in the common ancestor of Asclepios + Halobates, (3) the limnic
  lifestyle of some members of Halobates was independently derived from marine
  ancestors, and that (4) the open ocean was colonized at least three times in
  Halobates. A catalogue of Halobatinae organized according to an updated
  classification is presented, including all known geographic distributions,
  bibliographical references, and additional notes to all species of the
  subfamily."
