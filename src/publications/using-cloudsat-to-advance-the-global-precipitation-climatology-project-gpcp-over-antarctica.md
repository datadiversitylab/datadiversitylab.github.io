publicationAbstract: Remote sensing-based precipitation products face several
  challenges in high latitudes and specifically over frozen surfaces (i.e., snow
  and ice). Consequently, precipitation estimates tend to be lower in quality
  over these regions, including Antarctica, the coldest continent on Earth. In
  this study, we developed a method for adjusting precipitation estimates over
  Antarctica by leveraging CloudSat's ability to capture snowfall compared to
  other satellite products over snow and ice surfaces. We addressed limitations
  of CloudSat, such as poor spatiotemporal sampling, noise, and incomplete
  coverage near the poles. We utilized the European Centre for Medium-Range
  Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis 5th Generation (ERA5) to guide
  development, particularly during the period when the TIROS Operational
  Vertical Sounder (TOVS) was contributing. We adjusted monthly and seasonal
  TOVS and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder – Infrared (AIRS-IR) precipitation
  biases over Antarctica at the pixel level, as these two products are the
  primary inputs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) in high
  latitudes. We assessed the adjusted TOVS and AIRS-IR through analyses of
  geographical maps and time series of monthly and seasonal mean precipitation
  rates. The results are encouraging, indicating that the proposed approach
  could replace the current approach used in the GPCP for adjusting
  precipitation estimates from AIRS-IR and TOVS over Antarctica. Adjusting
  precipitation estimates from TOVS and AIRS-IR using the proposed approach
  improves the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) over their entire period by 162% and
  147%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach can be applied to adjust
  other precipitation products over Antarctica at the pixel level, including
  satellites and reanalysis products.
