publicationAbstract: Understanding how plants respond to thermal stress is
  central to predicting plant responses and community dynamics in natural
  ecosystems under projected scenarios of climate change. Although physiological
  tolerance is suggested to evolve slower than climatic niches, this comparison
  remains to be addressed in plants using a phylogenetic comparative approach.
  In this study, we compared i) the evolutionary rates of physiological
  tolerance to extreme temperatures with ii) the corresponding rates of climatic
  niche across three major vascular plant groups. We further accounted for the
  potential effects of hardening when examining the association between
  physiological and climatic niche rates. We found that physiological cold
  tolerance evolves faster than heat tolerance in all three groups. The coldest
  climatic-niche temperatures evolve faster than the warmest climatic-niche
  temperatures. Importantly, evolutionary rates of physiological cold tolerance
  were faster than rates of change in climatic niches. However, an inverse
  association between physiological cold tolerance and responding climatic niche
  for plants without hardening was detected. Our results indicated that plants
  may be sensitive to changes in warmer temperatures due to the slower
  evolutionary rates of heat tolerance. This pattern has deep implications for
  the framework that is being used to estimate climate-related extinctions over
  the upcoming century
