publicationAbstract: "Objectives: The reproductive and trophic ecology of
  Bryconamericus caucanus was analyzed in la Venada creek, Quindío river, Alto
  Cauca, Colombia. Materials and methods. Individuals were collected between
  January and December 2013. Multivariate analyses were performed to compare the
  trophic characteristics of the species between climatic periods (wet and dry),
  sexes, and sexual maturity (juvenile and adults). We also analyzed the
  condition factor (K) and the numerical (%N), volumetric (%V), and frequency
  (%Fo) percentages for each prey. We tested for deviations in the sex
  proportion using chi-squared tests and we also estimated the Gonodosomatic
  Index (GSI) and absolute fecundity (Fa). Results. A total of 162 individuals
  (SL: 40-75 mm) were here analyzed. B. caucanus is an insectivorous fish
  (86.47% IRI) that mainly feeds on the orders Ephemeroptera (Baetidae; 27.71%),
  Hymenoptera (Formicidae; 23.57%), Diptera (Simuliidae 17.36%; Chironomidae
  9.79%), and Trichoptera (Hydropsychidae; 8.04). Multivariate analyses showed
  differences between climatic periods, with the lowest richness occurring
  during dry season. Between sexes, females showed the widest trophic niche.
  Adults, on the other hand, showed a wider trophic niche than juveniles. The
  species has two reproductive peaks during rainy seasons which are also related
  to the increase in the trophic richness during the same periods (March-April,
  September-November). Conclusions. We found that B. caucanus has an incipient
  trophic differentiation between ontogenic stages and sexes. Trophic
  differences are remarkable between climatic periods. The two spawning periods
  for the species occur during the beginning of the wet seasons (March-April,
  September-November)."
