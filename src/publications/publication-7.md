publicationAbstract: Many biodiversity studies focus on explaining high tropical
  species richness, but an equally dramatic yet understudied pattern involves
  the divergent richness of land, sea and freshwater. Here, we reveal the
  origins of these richness differences among habitats across animals and
  plants. Most plant and animal species are terrestrial, although these habitats
  cover only ~28% of Earth's surface. Marine habitats have fewer species over a
  larger area (~70%). Freshwater habitats have relatively high richness and
  exceptional phylogenetic diversity given their tiny area (2%). The relative
  richness of habitats is related to variation in diversification rates. Based
  on ancestral reconstructions of habitat, we find that most marine species are
  descended from marine ancestors and most terrestrial species from freshwater
  ancestors. Yet, most extant animal richness in freshwater is derived from
  terrestrial ancestors. Overall, our results reveal the origins of fundamental
  but neglected biodiversity patterns, and highlight the conservation importance
  of freshwater habitats
