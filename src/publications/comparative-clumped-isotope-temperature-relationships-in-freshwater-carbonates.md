publicationAbstract: Lacustrine, riverine and spring carbonates represent
  archives of terrestrial climates and their geochemistry has been used to study
  palaeoenvironments. Clumped isotope thermometry is an emerging tool that has
  been applied to freshwater carbonates. Limited work has been done to evaluate
  comparative relationships between clumped isotopes and temperature in
  different types of modern freshwater carbonates. This study assembles an
  extensive calibration data set with 135 samples of modern freshwater
  carbonates from 96 sites and constrains the relationship between independent
  observations of water temperature and the clumped isotopic composition of
  carbonates (denoted by Δ47), including new measurements, and recalculates
  published data in accordance with current community-defined standard values.
  For temperature reconstruction, the study reports a composite freshwater
  calibration and material-specific calibrations for biogenic carbonates
  (freshwater gastropods and bivalves), fine-grained carbonate (e.g. micrites),
  biologically mediated carbonates (microbialites and tufas) and travertines.
  Material-specific calibration trends show a convergence of slopes that are in
  agreement with recently published syntheses, but statistically significant
  differences in intercepts occur between some materials (e.g. some biogenics,
  fine-grained carbonates). These differences may arise due to unresolved
  seasonal biases, kinetic isotope effects and/or varying degrees of biological
  influence. The impact of different calibrations is shown through application
  to new data for glacial and deglacial age travertines from Austria and
  published data sets. While material-specific calibrations may yield more
  accurate results for biogenic and fine-grained carbonate samples, the use of
  material-specific and the composite freshwater calibrations generally produces
  values within 1.0–1.5°C of each other, and typically fall within calibration
  uncertainty given limitations of precision.
