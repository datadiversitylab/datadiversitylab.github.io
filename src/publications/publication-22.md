publicationAbstract: "Aims: Islands are widely recognized as natural
  laboratories for evolutionary studies, but many questions about evolution on
  islands remain unresolved. Here we address two general questions from a
  macroevolutionary perspective. First, do lineages on islands have increased
  diversification rates relative to mainland lineages? Second, does the same
  geographical context (e.g., same archipelago) have similar effects on
  diversification in unrelated groups? We focused on Darwin’s finches and
  Galapagos tortoises, two endemic radiations from the Galapagos Islands, and
  the larger families in which they are embedded. Location: Global. Methods: We
  estimated a new time-calibrated phylogeny for tortoises (Testudinidae). Then,
  we examined their macroevolutionary patterns and compared them to those of
  Darwin’s finches and relatives (Thraupidae), using a published thraupid tree.
  Specifically, we estimated and compared diversification rates between islands
  and the mainland and between the Galapagos Islands and all other regions,
  using clade-based and species-based approaches. Results: Contrary to
  expectations, occurrence on islands in general did not significantly increase
  diversification rates in tanagers or tortoises. However, occurrence in the
  Galapagos Islands in particular was associated with increased speciation and
  diversification rates, and explained ~28% of the variation in diversification
  rates for thraupids and ~46% for testudinids. Both Darwin’s finches and
  Galapagos tortoises were unique within each family in exhibiting the highest
  diversification rates. The congruence of these macroevolutionary patterns
  between both radiations supports a strong “place-dependent” effect on
  diversification associated with the Galapagos. Finally, we found that Darwin’s
  finches diversified ~2–8 times faster than Galapagos tortoises. Main
  conclusions: Our results show that occurring on islands in general did not
  increase diversification rates in these clades, but occurrence in the
  Galapagos did. We also show that dramatic local-scale differences in
  diversification rates between clades in the Galapagos parallel global-scale
  differences in diversification rates between these families and between birds
  and turtles overall."
