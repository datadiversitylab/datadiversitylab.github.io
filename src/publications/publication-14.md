publicationAbstract: "Aim: The evolutionary causes of the latitudinal diversity
  gradient are debated. Hypotheses have ultimately invoked either faster rates
  of diversification in the tropics or more time for diversification owing to
  the tropical origins of higher taxa. Here, we perform the first test of the
  diversification rate and time hypotheses in freshwater ray-finned fishes, a
  group comprising nearly a quarter of all living vertebrates. Location: Global.
  Time period: 368–0 Ma. Major taxa studied: Extant freshwater ray-finned
  fishes. Methods: Using a mega-phylogeny of actinopterygian fishes and a global
  database of occurrence records, we estimated net diversification rates, the
  number of colonizations and regional colonization times of co-occurring
  species in freshwater drainage basins. We used generalized additive models to
  test whether these factors were related to latitude. We then compared the
  influence of diversification rates, numbers of colonizations, colonization
  times and surface area on species richness, and how these factors are related
  to each other. Results: Although both diversification rates and time were
  related to richness, time had greater explanatory power and was more strongly
  related to latitude than diversification rates. Other factors (basin surface
  area and number of colonizations) also helped to explain richness but were
  unrelated to latitude. The most diverse freshwater basins of the world (Amazon
  and Congo rivers) were dominated by lineages having Mesozoic origins. The
  temperate groups dominant today arrived near the Cretaceous–Palaeogene
  boundary, leaving comparatively less time to build richness. Diversification
  rates and colonization times were inversely related: recently colonized basins
  had the fastest rates, whereas ancient species-rich faunas had slower rates.
  Main conclusions: We concluded that time is the leading driver of latitudinal
  disparities in richness in freshwater fish faunas. We suggest that the most
  likely path to building very high species richness is through diversification
  over long periods of time, rather than through rapid diversification."
