publicationAbstract: Although polyploidy is widespread across the plant Tree of
  Life, its long-term evolutionary significance is still poorly understood.
  Here, we examine the effects of polyploidy in explaining the large-scale
  evolutionary patterns within angiosperms by focusing on a single family
  exhibiting extensive interspecific variation in chromosome numbers. We
  inferred ploidy from haploid chromosome numbers for 80% of species in the most
  comprehensive species-level chronogram for the Brassicaceae. After evaluating
  a total of 94 phylogenetic models of diversification, we found that ploidy
  influences diversification rates across the Brassicaceae. We also found that
  despite diversifying at a similar rate to diploids, polyploids have played a
  significant role in driving present-day differences in species richness among
  clades. Overall, in addition to highlighting the complexity in the
  evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, our results suggest that rare
  successful polyploids persist while significantly contributing to the
  long-term evolution of clades. Our findings further indicate that polyploidy
  has played a major role in driving the longterm evolution of the Brassicaceae
  and highlight the potential of polyploidy in shaping present-day diversity
  patterns across the plant Tree of Life.
