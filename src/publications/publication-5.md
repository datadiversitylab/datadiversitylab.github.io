publicationAbstract: A new species of Tiger Gecko in the genus Goniurosaurus is
  described from Guangdong, China. This new species, Goniurosaurus wangshu sp.
  nov. is the fifth species of Goniurosaurus found in karst topography of
  Guangdong. It is distinguished morphologically from congeners in this region
  by the combination of thirteen precloacal pores in male; dorsal ground color
  of head, body, and limbs in adults yellow; and iris orange. To validate our
  morphological inferences and support the description of Goniurosaurus wangshu
  sp. nov. as a new species, we sequenced 16S, CMOS, cytb, and RAG1 gene regions
  and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis places
  the new species within the G. yingdeensis group and highlights the
  evolutionary distinction between this new species and other described
  congeners
