publicationAbstract: What an animal eats is a fundamental aspect of its biology,
  but the evolution of diet has not been studied across animal phylogeny. Here,
  we performed a large-scale phylogenetic analysis to address three unresolved
  questions about the evolution of animal diets. (i) Are diets conserved across
  animal phylogeny? (ii) Does diet influence rates of species proliferation
  (diversification) among animal phyla? (iii) What was the ancestral diet of
  animals and major animal clades? We analyzed diet data for 1087 taxa,
  proportionally sampled among animal phyla based on the relative species
  richness of phyla. Our survey suggests that across animals, carnivory is most
  common (63%), herbivory less common (32%), and omnivory relatively rare (3%).
  Despite considerable controversy over whether ecological traits are conserved
  or labile, we found strong conservatism in diet over extraordinarily deep
  timescales. We found that diet is unrelated to rates of species
  diversification across animal phyla, contrasting with previous studies showing
  that herbivory increased diversification within some important groups (e.g.,
  crustaceans, insects, and mammals). Finally, we estimated that the ancestor of
  all animals was most likely carnivorous, as were many major phyla (e.g.,
  arthropods, molluscs, and chordates). Remarkably, our results suggest that
  many carnivorous species living today may have maintained this diet through a
  continuous series of carnivorous ancestors for >800 million years.
