publicationAbstract: "Urban evolutionary ecology is inherently
  interdisciplinary. Moreover, it is a field with global significance. However,
  bringing researchers and resources together across fields and countries is
  challenging. Therefore, an online collaborative research hub, where common
  methods and best practices are shared among scientists from diverse
  geographic, ethnic, and career backgrounds would make research focused on
  urban evolutionary ecology more inclusive. Here, we describe a freely
  available online research hub for toolkits that facilitate global research in
  urban evolutionary ecology. We provide rationales and descriptions of toolkits
  for: (1) decolonizing urban evolutionary ecology; (2) identifying and
  fostering international collaborative partnerships; (3) common methods and
  freely-available datasets for trait mapping across cities; (4) common methods
  and freely-available datasets for cross-city evolutionary ecology experiments;
  and (5) best practices and freely available resources for public outreach and
  communication of research findings in urban evolutionary ecology. We outline
  how the toolkits can be accessed, archived, and modified over time in order to
  sustain long-term global research that will advance our understanding of urban
  evolutionary ecology."
