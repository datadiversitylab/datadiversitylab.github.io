publicationAbstract: "To date, only two whip spider species have been recorded
  in China. We describe a new species, Sarax sinensis sp. nov., from Fujian,
  China. This species is morphologically similar to S. ioanniticus (Kritscher,
  1959), S. israelensis (Miranda et al., 2016), and S. seychellarum (Kraepelin,
  1898), but can be distinguished by the combination of the following
  characters: 35 segments in leg I tarsus, eight teeth on cheliceral claw, and
  four dorsal and ventral spines respectively on pedipalp femur. To examine the
  evolutionary history of S. sinensis sp. nov., we sequenced 12S, 16S, and COI
  gene regions of our specimens and inferred its phylogenetic position. The
  inferred phylogenetic trees placed the new species within Sarax, with its
  closest relative being distributed across the western Asia. The type specimens
  are deposited in the Museum of Biology, East China Normal University (ECNU)."
