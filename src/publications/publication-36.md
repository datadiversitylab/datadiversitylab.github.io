  una quebrada de alta montaña en los Andes de Colombia

publicationAbstract: "To analyze the degree of trophic overlap, 2 species of
  Neotropical characins were considered: Hemibrycon brevispini and
  Bryconamericus caucanus. Both species have been identified as having an
  insectivorous diet with a tendency to consume mayflies, hymenopterans, and
  dipterans. It was found that these fish share 65% of food items, which is
  reflected in their high trophic overlap (QS = 0.620). There is also no
  difference between the abundances of prey consumed. The values of trophic
  breadth, diversity, evenness, and richness were higher in B. caucanus than in
  H. brevispini, which explains the ecological flexibility exhibited by B.
  caucanus throughout its wide range of geographical distribution compared to H.
  brevispini. In these taxa, syntopy is mainly due to the high abundance of
  resources available during the year"
