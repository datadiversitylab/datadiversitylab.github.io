publicationTitle: "BARMPy: Bayesian Additive Regression Models Python Package"
publicationAuthor: Danielle Van Boxel
publicationDate: "2024"
publicationType: arXiv
publicationAbstract: We make Bayesian Additive Regression Networks (BARN)
  available as a Python package, `barmpy`, with documentation at this
  [url](https://dvbuntu.github.io/barmpy/) for general machine learning
  practitioners. Our object-oriented design is compatible with SciKit-Learn,
  allowing usage of their tools like cross-validation. To ease learning to use
  `barmpy`, we produce a companion tutorial that expands on reference
  information in the documentation. Any interested user can `pip install barmpy`
  from the official `PyPi` repository. `barmpy` also serves as a baseline Python
  library for generic Bayesian Additive Regression Models.
