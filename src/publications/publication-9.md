publicationAbstract: "To date, only one species of whip spider has been recorded
  in China. Here, we describe a new species, Weygoldtia hainanensis sp. nov.,
  from Hainan, China. The new species is morphologically similar to W. davidovi
  (Fage, 1946) and W. consonensis Miranda et al. 2021, but can be distinguished
  with a combination of the following characters: 26 segments in tibia I, 6-7
  teeth on chelicerae, distitibia IV trichobothria sc and sf series each with
  10-11 trichobothria. To validate our morphological inferences and support the
  erection of W. hainanensis sp. nov. as a new species, we sequenced the COI
  gene region for two individuals and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses.
  The inferred phylogenetic trees placed the new species within Weygoldtia and
  highlighted the evolutionary distinction between W. hainanensis sp. nov. and
  currently described whip spiders. The type specimens are deposited in the
  Museum of Biology, East China Normal University (ECNU)."
