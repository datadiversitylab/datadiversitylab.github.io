publicationAbstract: With more than 900 valid species, Psocidae is the most
  diverse family of psocodeans. Even though the availability of molecular has
  allowed hypothesizing on the phylogenetic relations for the different
  lineages, the evolutionary timing is still poorly discussed and the influence
  of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on their diversification is hitherto
  unknown. In this paper, we aim to test the temporal congruence of three
  evidences (i.e., two fossils and one biogeographical constraint), and discuss
  the correlation between clade’s age and other major events (e.g., geological,
  ecological). We found that family Psocidae likely diverged during the Mesozoic
  – Paleozoic transition. Moreover, the subsequent splits of the major
  sub-lineages occurred in a short time interval between 68 to 77 Mya. These
  dates also correspond to diversification shifts in multiple angiosperm
  lineages and the increase in global temperature.
