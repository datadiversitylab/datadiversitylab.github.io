publicationTitle: "treedata.table: a wrapper for data.table that enables fast
  manipulation of large phylogenetic trees matched to data"
publicationAuthor: Cristian Rom√°n-Palacios, April Wright, and Josef Uyeda

publicationType: PeerJ
publicationAbstract: The number of terminals in phylogenetic trees has
  significantly increased over the last decade. This trend reflects recent
  advances in next-generation sequencing, accessibility of public data
  repositories, and the increased use of phylogenies in many fields. Despite R
  being central to the analysis of phylogenetic data, manipulation of
  phylogenetic comparative datasets remains slow, complex, and poorly
  reproducible. Here, we describe the first R package extending the
  functionality and syntax of data.table to explicitly deal with phylogenetic
  comparative datasets. treedata.table significantly increases speed and
  reproducibility during the data manipulation steps involved in the
  phylogenetic comparative workflow in R. The latest release of treedata.table
  is currently available through CRAN
  (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/treedata.table/). Additional
  documentation can be accessed through rOpenSci
  (https://ropensci.github.io/treedata.table/).
