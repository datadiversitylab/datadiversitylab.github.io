publicationAbstract: We present a list of 720 species of ‘Psocoptera’ recorded
  in Colombia, based on the examination of specimens deposited in the
  collections of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute and in the Entomological
  Museum of the Universidad del Valle. We include records of specimens recently
  collected in several National Natural Parks and other natural areas in
  Colombia. Species previously recorded in the literature are also listed here.
  The number of psocids recorded in Colombia until 2002 (79 species)
  corresponded to only 11.0% of what is currently known based on our study. We
  highlight that about 60% of the species recorded since 2010 were undescribed,
  135 of which have been recently described by our research group. An
  identification key to the 28 psocid families known in Colombia is included.
  Even though psocids have been largely ignored from the taxonomic research in
  Colombia, we show that the group diversity is still to be uncovered in the
  country. Further studies must be conducted to understand the distribution of
  psocids among and within localities, and emphasize that additional extensive
  fieldwork is highly required.
