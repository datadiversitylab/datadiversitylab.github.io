publicationAbstract: "Whereas more than 10 % of global amphibian richness is
  known to occur in Colombia, almost 16 % of these species are currently
  classified as Data Deficient according to the IUCN. These estimates suggest
  that the available data for a large portion of amphibians occurring in
  Colombia is insufficient to assess extinction risk. Here we aim to (1) review
  the available information on the distribution of the Colombian Data Deficient
  (DD hereafter) amphibians, (2) analyze their geographic distribution, and (3)
  evaluate the relationship between anthropogenic impact and their current
  conservation status. For this, we first compiled geographical records for the
  DD amphibian species using primary sources. Geographical records were obtained
  mainly from taxonomic descriptions and non-systematic surveys. We then
  estimated the geographical range and inferred the potential distribution for
  each species using letsR and MaxEnt, respectively. We quantified the human
  footprint for each species and tested the relationship between spatial
  distribution and anthropogenic change across populations. Analyses are here
  based on 128 of the 129 DD amphibian species that occur in Colombia. We found
  that most of these species were recently described and have small geographic
  ranges. A large proportion of these DD amphibians inhabit the Colombian Andes,
  and their populations have been strongly affected by human activities.
  Overall, the spatial clustering suggests that many of these species have faced
  similar environmental and anthropogenic pressures that have contributed to
  their rareness. We also suggest that the conservation status for several of
  the analyzed DD amphibians should be changed to account for the threats they
  face. Rev. Biol. Trop. 66(3): 1272-1281. Epub 2018 September 01."
