publicationTitle: "BARMPy: Bayesian additive regression models Python package"
publicationAuthor: Danielle Van Boxel
publicationDate: "2024"
publicationMonth: Aug
publicationType: Computational Statistics
publicationAbstract: We make Bayesian additive regression networks (BARN)
  available as a Python package, barmpy, with documentation at
  <https://dvbuntu.github.io/barmpy/> for general machine learning
  practitioners. Our object-oriented design is compatible with SciKit-Learn,
  allowing usage of their tools like cross-validation. To ease learning to use
  barmpy, we produce a companion tutorial that expands on reference information
  in the documentation. Any interested user can pip install barmpy from the
  official PyPi repository. barmpy also serves as a baseline Python library for
  generic Bayesian additive regression models.
