publicationAbstract: Much of what we know about speciation comes from detailed
  studies of well-known model systems. Although there have been several
  important syntheses on speciation, few (if any) have explicitly compared
  speciation among major groups across the Tree of Life. Here, we synthesize and
  compare what is known about key aspects of speciation across taxa, including
  bacteria, protists, fungi, plants, and major animal groups. We focus on three
  main questions. Is allopatric speciation predominant across groups? How common
  is ecological divergence of sister species (a requirement for ecological
  speciation), and on what niche axes do species diverge in each group? What are
  the reproductive isolating barriers in each group? Our review suggests the
  following patterns. (i) Based on our survey and projected species numbers, the
  most frequent speciation process across the Tree of Life may be co-speciation
  between endosymbiotic bacteria and their insect hosts. (ii) Allopatric
  speciation appears to be present in all major groups, and may be the most
  common mode in both animals and plants, based on non-overlapping ranges of
  sister species. (iii) Full sympatry of sister species is also widespread, and
  may be more common in fungi than allopatry. (iv) Full sympatry of sister
  species is more common in some marine animals than in terrestrial and
  freshwater ones. (v) Ecological divergence of sister species is widespread in
  all groups, including ~70% of surveyed species pairs of plants and insects.
  (vi) Major axes of ecological divergence involve species interactions (e.g.
  host-switching) and habitat divergence. (vii) Prezygotic isolation appears to
  be generally more widespread and important than postzygotic isolation. (viii)
  Rates of diversification (and presumably speciation) are strikingly different
  across groups, with the fastest rates in plants, and successively slower rates
  in animals, fungi, and protists, with the slowest rates in prokaryotes.
  Overall, our study represents an initial step towards understanding general
  patterns in speciation across all organisms.
