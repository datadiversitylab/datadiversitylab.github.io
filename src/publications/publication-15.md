publicationAbstract: "Five species of geckos in the genus Goniurosaurus had been
  recorded from Guangxi, China. Here we describe a new species, Goniurosaurus
  gezhi sp. nov. Zhu, He & Li. The new species is similar to those found in
  Guangxi and Guizhou provinces of China and Northern Vietnam, but unique in a
  combination of the following characters: (1) three body bands between limb
  insertions; (2) precloacal pores 18–20; (3) body small (SVL=70.6–83.8 mm); (4)
  body color orange to yellow. We evaluated the phylogenetic position of this
  new species based on the 16S mitochondrial gene. Molecular phylogenies
  validate this new species as distinct to currently described lineages within
  Goniurosaurus. The type specimens are deposited in the Museum of Biology, East
  China Normal University (ECNU)."
