publicationAbstract: Climate change may be a major threat to biodiversity in the
  next 100 years. Although there has been important work on mechanisms of
  decline in some species, it generally remains unclear which changes in climate
  actually cause extinctions, and how many species will likely be lost. Here, we
  identify the specific changes in climate that are associated with the
  widespread local extinctions that have already occurred. We then use this
  information to predict the extent of future biodiversity loss and to identify
  which processes may forestall extinction. We used data from surveys of 538
  plant and animal species over time, 44% of which have already had local
  extinctions at one or more sites. We found that locations with local
  extinctions had larger and faster changes in hottest yearly temperatures than
  those without. Surprisingly, sites with local extinctions had significantly
  smaller changes in mean annual temperatures, despite the widespread use of
  mean annual temperatures as proxies for overall climate change. Based on their
  past rates of dispersal, we estimate that 57–70% of these 538 species will not
  disperse quickly enough to avoid extinction. However, we show that niche
  shifts appear to be far more important for avoiding extinction than dispersal,
  although most studies focus only on dispersal. Specifically, considering both
  dispersal and niche shifts, we project that only 16–30% of these 538 species
  may go extinct by 2070. Overall, our results help identify the specific
  climatic changes that cause extinction and the processes that may help species
  to survive
