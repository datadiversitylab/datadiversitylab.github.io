  Effective collaboration, essential for success in academic environments, often
  requires efficient team communication and access to a team-oriented digital
  infrastructure. Despite the significance of efficient and effective
  collaboration within the academy, a standardized  and structured suite for
  collaboration remains relatively overlooked. In the context of research labs,
  where multiple levels of collaboration 

  often coexist, the ability to communicate and share resources in a 

  timely and secure manner is critical. Modern research teams and 

  institutions have historically attempted to solve these needs through 

  proprietary, largely restrictive, and inflexible tools. Free and Open 

  Source Software (FOSS) has facilitated the development of our modern 

  computer-focused world by virtue of its legal, customizable, and 

  accessible nature. However, FOSS remains weakly used for supporting 

  communication, collaborative writing, storage, and other tasks within 

  research labs. This paper discusses the implementation of a FOSS 

  computational workflow for active collaboration within academic 

  environments. We focus on identifying available tools that can support 

  collaborative writing, instant messaging, data storage, among other 

  tasks. The Lab Operations (LabOps) workflow presented in this 

  paper—which can be self-hosted, adapted, and adopted at different 

  levels—offers an alternative approach to off-the-shelf proprietary 

  solutions for both within- and cross-lab communication. We discuss the 

  benefits, flexibility, limitations, and potential approaches to adoption
   of the workflow.
