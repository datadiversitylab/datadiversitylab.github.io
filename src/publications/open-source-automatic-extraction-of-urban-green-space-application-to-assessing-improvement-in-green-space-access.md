publicationAbstract: Urban Green Space (UGS) is vital for improving the public
  health and sustainability of cities. Vector data on UGS such as open data from
  governments and OpenStreetMap are available for retrieval by interested users,
  but the availability of UGS data is still limited on global and temporal
  scales. This study develops the UGS Extractor, a web-based application for the
  automatic extraction of UGS given user inputs of Area of Interest and Date of
  Interest. To accommodate various types of green spaces, such as parks or
  lawns, the application additionally allows users to set parameters for the
  minimum size of each UGS and the Minimum Urban Neighbor Density, enabling
  customization of what qualifies as UGS. The UGS Extractor implements a
  methodological framework that applies object-based image processing, edge
  detection and extraction, and image neighborhood analysis on the near
  real-time 10m Dynamic World collection of Land Use/Land Cover images. The
  application’s utility was demonstrated through two case studies. In the first,
  the UGS Extractor accurately mapped major parks when compared to open data
  sources in New Orleans, USA. In the second, the UGS Extractor demonstrated
  significant increases in the total area of UGS from 2015 to 2023 in Songdo,
  South Korea, which consequently improved green space accessibility. These
  results underscore the UGS Extractor’s utility in extracting specific types of
  UGS and analyzing their temporal trends. This user-friendly application
  overall offers higher spatial resolution compared to publicly available
  satellite-based methods while facilitating temporal studies not possible with
  vector datasets.
