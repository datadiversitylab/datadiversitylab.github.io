publicationTitle: "The phruta R package: increasing access, reproducibility, and
  transparency in phylogenetic analyses"

publicationAbstract: Current practices for assembling phylogenetic trees often
  recur to sequence data stored in GenBank. However, the molecular and taxonomic
  make-up of sequences deposited in GenBank is generally not very clear. phruta,
  a newly developed r package, is designed to primarily improve access to
  genetic data stored in GenBank. Functions in phruta further enable users to
  assemble single- and multi-gene molecular datasets, and run basic phylogenetic
  tasks, all within r. The structure of the functions implemented in phruta aim
  to allow users to assemble simple workflows for particular tasks, which are in
  turn expected to increase reproducibility of relatively simple phylogenies. To
  support the use of phruta by researchers in different fields with variable
  levels of coding expertise, this paper presents the first version of
  salphycon, a shiny web app that aims to increase access to the fundamental
  functions in the phruta r package.
