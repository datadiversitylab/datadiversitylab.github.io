publicationAbstract: Machine learning is a robust framework to analyze questions
  using complex data in a variety of fields. We present definitions and recent
  applications of four key machine learning methods and discuss their advantages
  and challenges in biological research. Through a set of systematically
  selected case studies, we highlight how machine learning models have been used
  in a range of applications, including phylogenomics, disease prediction, and
  host taxonomy prediction. We identify additional potential areas of
  integration of machine learning into questions with biological relevance. This
  intersection can be further enhanced through collaboration and innovation on
  parallelization, interpretability, and preprocessing.
