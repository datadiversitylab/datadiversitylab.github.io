publicationAbstract: When based on phylogenetic proposals, biogeographic
  historic narratives have a great interest for hypothesizing paths of origin of
  the current biodiversity. Among the many questions that remain unsolved about
  psocids, the distribution of Thyrsophorini represents still a remarkable
  enigma. This tribe had been considered as exclusively Neotropical, until the
  description of Thyrsopsocopsis thorntoni Mockford, 2004, from Vietnam. Three
  hypotheses have been proposed to explain this atypical distribution, recurring
  to dispersal, vicariance and morphological parallelism between lineages, but
  the lack of evidence has not allowed a unique support. Here, we describe a new
  Neotropical species of Thyrsopsocopsis, and also attempt to test the three
  biogeographical hypotheses in a phylogenetic context. In our analyses, the
  position of Cycetes (Cycetini) and Thyrsopsocopsis among Thyrsophorini psocids
  is well resolved, suggesting a dispersal event from the Neotropics for both
  genera.
