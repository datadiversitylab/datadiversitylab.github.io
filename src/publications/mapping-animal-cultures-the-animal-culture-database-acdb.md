publicationAbstract: Socially transmitted behaviors are widespread across the
  animal kingdom, yet comprehensive datasets documenting their distribution and
  ecological significance remain scarce. Additionally, knowledge of animal
  behavioral traditions could be essential for understanding many species’
  responses to anthropogenic disturbances and further enhancing conservation
  efforts. Here, we introduce the first open-access database that synthesizes
  data on animal cultural behaviors and traditions. The Animal Culture Database
  (ACDB) summarizes culture-related features for a total of 56 species. The
  current release of the database contains descriptions of 112 behaviors
  including forms of vocal communication, migration, predator defense, foraging
  practices, habitat alteration, play, mating displays, and other social
  behaviors for 102 bird and mammal populations across six continents. In
  addition to offering an open-access resource for researchers, educators, and
  conservationists, the ACDB represents a critical step toward recognizing the
  role of social learning in animal populations.
