publicationAbstract: Socially transmitted behaviors are widespread across the
  animal kingdom, yet there is a lack of comprehensive datasets documenting
  their distribution and ecological significance. Knowledge of animal behavioral
  traditions could be essential for understanding many species’ responses to
  anthropogenic disturbances and further enhancing conservation efforts. Here,
  we introduce the first open-access database that synthesizes data on animal
  cultural behaviors and traditions. The Animal Culture Database (ACDB) contains
  descriptions of 128 behaviors including forms of vocal communication,
  migration, predator defense, foraging practices, habitat alteration, play,
  mating displays, and other social behaviors for an initial sample of 61
  species. In addition to offering an open-access resource for researchers,
  educators, and conservationists, the ACDB represents a step toward recognizing
  the role of social learning in animal populations.
