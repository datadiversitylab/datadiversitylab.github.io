publicationAbstract: Although many studies looking at the role that sexual
  selection plays in macroevolution have focused on the involvement of visual
  and acoustic signals, the potential influence of chemical communication
  remains unexplored. Instead of focusing on well-studied instances of sexually
  selected traits, Murali et al. analyze chemical communication to test whether
  sexual selection could help explain large-scale species diversity patterns in
  lizards. Their results suggest that, at least in lizards, chemical
  communication is uncoupled from differential diversification dynamics across
  clades.
