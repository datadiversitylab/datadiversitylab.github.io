publicationAbstract: "Hemibrycon brevispini is a Neotropical characid fish
  endemic in La Venada Creek, a headwater tributary of the Quindío River of
  Colombia (Cauca River drainage). It is mainly a diurnal insectivore with a
  diet dominated by benthic dipterans (Chironomidae, Simuliidae, Psychodidae,
  Culicidae, Calliphoridae, Dixidae and Muscidae), hymenopterans (Formicidae and
  Vespidae) and ephemeropterans (Baetidae), as well as allochthonous prey and
  items eaten accidentally. Microhabitats of mountain streams with lower water
  velocity tend to have more riparian vegetation and the associated terrestrial
  arthropods that are consumed by H. brevispini. It has three peaks in
  reproduction: December, April and August. Average fecundity was 776 mature
  oocytes per female."
