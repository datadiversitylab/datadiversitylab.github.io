publicationAbstract: Two new species of *Elaphopsocoides* n. gen. from Valle del
  Cauca, Colombia, are here described and illustrated. The new genus is related
  to Elaphopsocus Roesler, but differs from it mostly in the hypandrial
  projections and in phallosome structure. The female subgenital plate has a
  distinct, median, posterior projection. The types are deposited in the
  Entomology Museum, Universidad del Valle (MUSENUV), Santiago de Cali,
  Colombia.
