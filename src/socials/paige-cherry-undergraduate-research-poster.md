publicationAbstract: Paige is assisting on a comparative database of animal
  culture and behavior. Her poster consisted of a highlight of two selected
  papers on animal culture, focusing on their findings about animal behavior,
  social learning, and culturally significant actions. While presenting, Paige
  explains the authors' methods and how their work connects to the broader
  project. The ultimate goal is to create an open-access resource that combines
  data on animal cultures with existing ecological databases to enhance research
