publicationAbstract: Paige is assisting on a comparative database of animal culture
  and behavior. Her poster consisted of a highlight of two selected papers on animal
  culture, focusing on their findings about animal behavior, social learning, and
  culturally significant actions. While presenting, Paige explains the authors' methods
  and how their work connects to the broader project. The ultimate goal is to create
  an open-access resource that combines data on animal cultures with existing ecological
  databases to enhance research and accessibility.
