publicationAbstract: As a lab, we we decorated our door to show a little more
  about our members and what the lab is about. Each member chose their favorite
  Arizona species and cut out their footprints, these were then placed on the
  door to show that the animals were walking in and out of the door. This was a
  great way to bond as a lab and intersected well with our foundations in
  biology and ecology.
