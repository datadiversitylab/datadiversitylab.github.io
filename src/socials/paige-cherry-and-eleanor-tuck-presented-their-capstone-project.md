  focused their capstone project on the macroevolution of Galápagos Testudinids.
  They created a website and performed basic macroevolutionary analyses on
  recently published time-calibrated phylogenies! Swetha Kolloju also presented
  her capstone project (advised by Cristian Román and Sarah Bratt) on describing
  the structure of software use in phylogenetics. Congratulations to all, we
  love to recognize your hard work!
