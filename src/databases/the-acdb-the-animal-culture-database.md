Name: "The ACDB: The Animal Culture Database"
Description: The Animal Culture Database (ACDB) is a database of cultural
  behaviors across nonhuman animal species. It synthesizes current literature on
  intra-species behavioral variation in contexts such as communication,
  foraging, and migration, along with data on effects of human disturbances to
  the environment, to facilitate comparative research on interactions between
  animal social learning and climate change.
