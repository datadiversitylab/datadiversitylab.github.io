Name: "Dataset used for: Recent responses to climate change reveal the
  drivers   of species extinction and survival"
Description: The dataset includes survey data from 538 plant and animal species
  over time, with 44% experiencing local extinctions. It supports analyses of
  climate change impacts on biodiversity, identifying key climatic drivers of
  extinction and assessing the roles of dispersal and niche shifts in species
  survival projections.
