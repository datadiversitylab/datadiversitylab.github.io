Name: "Dataset used for: Polyploidy increases overall diversity despite
  higher   turnover than diploids in the Brassicaceae"
Description: The dataset includes haploid chromosome numbers for 80% of species
  in the most comprehensive species-level chronogram for the Brassicaceae. It
  supports analyses of polyploidyâ€™s influence on diversification rates, species
  richness, and long-term evolutionary patterns within the family.
