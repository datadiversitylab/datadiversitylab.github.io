title: What suggestions would you make to improve this section?
---
2019 - I think one suggestion is that his voice is a bit low and a bit fast. Therefore, I think he should slow down a bit in the lecture portion and engage students a bit more in interactive activities.

2019 - slow down when going through the slideshow, don't call students out post-presentation...

2018 - Cristine needs to practice speaking clearer when he is flustered/excited. It was just hard to understand him.

2018 - grading criteria changes & is unclear. cannot understand TA's accent. Lack of English proficiency makes his explanations confusing, i.e. TA: "there are petidoglycan in that tissue sample" Me: "so there are multiple peptidoglycan?" TA: "no there is only one" See how improper grammar causes his explanations to be incorrect and misleading?

2017 - I do not think any changes need to be made; this lab was excellent!

2016 - Grading was fair in the begging, then out of nowhere it changed to harsh grading without notice. Therefore, I would suggest making grading less harsh and more fair.

2016 - The TA did a great job, but a lot of the procedures in the lab manual just didn't feel important. A lot of the sections felt like busy work. I don't have a great way to improve this, but I would try to incorporate some kind of feedback where students are asked which lab section specifically didn't work and which ones worked well.
