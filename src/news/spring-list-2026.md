* Ian Estacio, one of our postdocs, recently submitted his paper, "Effect of urban greening on walking frequencies across socioeconomic groups: Exploratory insights from agent-based modeling". A blurb about the paper: Urban greening may enhance the walkability of cities, ultimately reflecting a wide range of health, social, and economic benefits for residents. Yet, there is still a lack of studies showing how urban greening improves walking frequencies across socioeconomic groups. In this study, we developed TrecSim (Tree Effect on walking Comfort Simulator), an agent-based model for simulating the effect of tree planting on the walking frequencies of commuters across socioeconomic groups. Congratulations Ian!
* One of our postdocs, Kiran Basava, and our PI, Cristian Román-Palacios were both mentioned in a Discover Magazine article by Richard Pallardy, for the 2026 Year of Science Addition. This article was related to animal culture and the animal culture database, see a short blurb on this LinkedIn post: [Discover Article Feature](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rpallardy_yearinscience-biology-zoology-activity-7403964403739639808--U_T?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAFB9MzUBAk1IHVoi-OEmEeBTbJYXBlZBapk) - Congratulations to you both!
* Two of our postdocs, Kristen Martinet and Kiran Basava, both started a teaching role this semester alongside current University of Arizona professors. We know you will both do great, congratulations!
