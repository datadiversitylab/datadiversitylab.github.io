* The Data Diversity Lab was a part of creating a grant application for the University of Arizona's Big Idea Challenge. Their grant surrounding solving biological issues with a unified biological landscape terraformation was recently funded! Congratulations to all that were involved and we are looking forward to being a part of this project!
