* Two of our amazing postdocs, Kristen Martinet and Kiran Basava were recently accepted into the CIRTL Postdoc Pathways Program! This year-long program will allow the two of them along with 21 others to in the fall, learn strategies for creating an inclusive and engaging classroom environment. In the spring, they will each work collaboritively with a faculty member to create lessons for a course that will be taught at the University of Arizona. Congratulations to both Kristen and Kiran for this amazing opportunity!
