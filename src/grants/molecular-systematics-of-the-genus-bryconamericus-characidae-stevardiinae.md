grantDesc: The genus Bryconamericus comprises 79 species of small characid
  fishes found in Central and South America. Recent phylogenetic analyses have
  suggested its polyphyly, but the extent of conclusions was limited due to
  constraints in taxon sampling (33 species 1). Although the lineage's polyphyly
  has been suspected for a long time (but not formally tested until recently),
  its taxonomic definition and species composition are currently matter of
  intense debate. Here we aim to extend the taxonomic sampling within
  Bryconamericus species from 33 species 1 to 68 species. Specifically, this
  project will allow us to provide a new generic definition for Bryconamericus,
  and infer the phylogenetic position of previously unsampled species (i.e.,
  incertae sedis sensu 1).
