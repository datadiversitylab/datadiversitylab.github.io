grantDesc: This project seeks to equip Colombian Biology students and
  researchers with fundamental computational  tools in programming and
  phylogenetic comparative methods (PCM) in R. Historically, research in biology
  within Colombia has relied on methodologies, packages, and phylogenies
  developed by researchers from  the Global North. The focus of this research
  has oftentimes be related to biological diversity in the Global  South. The
  goal of this project is to provide the foundations to shifting this paradigm
  from tools and  methods developed in the global north to congruent fameworks
  developed in the Global South. Our project  aims to teach students and
  researchers fundamental methods that will enable them to enhance both R
  and  PCM toolboxes from a more equitable perspective. We will select students
  from public institutions in  Colombia and will conduct workshops in the same
  institutions. These universities are strongly underserved  by the Colombian
  government and students are often not exposed to fundamental tools that could
  help them move forward in the field. We will introduce the fundamental
  concepts of programming in R. Next, we will  provide pragmatic introductions
  to PCM in R. As a direct consequence to this experience, attendees of
  the  events will have the opportunity to coauthor a major publication. This
  publication will explore  reconstructed time-calibrated phylogenies on
  understudied clades across the Tree of Life. This project  represents an
  unique opportunity to enhance the research in biology while fostering a
  generation of well- equipped scientists in the Global South who can navigate
  and shape the future of our field.
