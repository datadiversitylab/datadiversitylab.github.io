grantName: Historical Biogeography and Extinction Risk Assessment of Recently
  Extinct Animals
grantYears: "2024"
pi: Cristian Román-Palacios
grantAmount: ~$4,000
grantDesc: We will collect information on the natural history and geographic
  distribution of recently animal extinct species (based on criteria from The
  International Union for Conservation of Nature). We will then use phylogenetic
  and non-phylogenetic model-based approaches to detect patterns and drivers of
  extinction in the dataset. This research project comprises five key components
  focused on understanding events related to biodiversity loss. First, data
  collection will focus on compiling lists of extinct animal species, along with
  their distribution data, natural history information, and phylogenetic data.
  Second, GIS tools will be employed for landscape reconstructions, wherein
  human impact and geographical changes will be integrated into inferred species
  distributions. Third, phylogenetic methods, including ancestral range
  reconstructions, will be utilized to delineate the historical ranges of
  extinct species and their relatives. Fourth, a comparative analysis will be
  conducted to test for distributional changes between extinct species and close
  relatives, with the aim of identifying potential drivers of extinction. Fifth,
  Species Distribution Models (SDMs) will be incorporated to generate
  interpretations of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to recent
  extinction events.
