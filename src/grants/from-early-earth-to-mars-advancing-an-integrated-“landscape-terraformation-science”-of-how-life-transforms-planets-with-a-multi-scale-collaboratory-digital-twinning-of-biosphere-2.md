grantName: "From early Earth to Mars: Advancing an integrated “Landscape
  Terraformation science” of how life transforms planets with a multi-scale
  collaboratory digital twinning of Biosphere 2"
grantYears: "2025"
pi: Cristian Román-Palacios
grantAmount: $250,000
grantDesc: Our grand challenge is to solve global problems with a unified
  science of biological Landscape Terraformation, a science inspired by the
  vision of maintaining, or newly creating, sustainable complex multifunction
  ecosystems that support biodiverse lifeforms including human communities on
  Earth, Mars, and beyond. With the advent of powerful AI models, real-time
  sensing, and digital twin technologies, we now have unprecedented ability to
  couple experimentation with intelligent computation. Thus, our Big Idea is to
  develop an intelligent, multi-scale dynamic “collaboratory” that learns from
  real-world experimentation in UA’s unique Landscape Evolution Observatory
  (LEO) at Biosphere 2, in order to predict, trigger, and steer terraformation
  processes. Our international team spans interdisciplinary natural science
  (astrobiology/ecology, geochemistry, hydrology, atmospheric, and planetary
  science); engineering and mathematics (AI, computer and information sciences);
  and social sciences, humanities, and the arts to address the multiplanetary
  advance of our species in all its dimensions. With scientific research,
  workshops, and digital twin model development, we will attract large-scale
  extramural support through federal, private, foundation, and international
  partnerships. The key impact will be a transformative leap in how we
  understand, design, and sustain living ecosystems, to better foster both
  ecological resilience on Earth, and the sustainable expansion of life beyond
  Earth.
