grantName: "NRT-HDR: CAMBIUM - Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation through
  Biodiversity Informatics Education and Mentoring"
grantAmount: $250
grantDesc: "As the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
  Ecosystem Services (IPBES) makes clear, Earth is at a biodiversity tipping
  point, with over one-million species threatened with extinction. A major
  driver of this extinction is climate change with dire consequences for all
  life. Animal, plant, human, and environmental systems synergistically
  influence the health of each system. This concept, known as One Health,
  suggests that the feedback loops among systems impacted by climate change and
  biodiversity loss will have myriad consequences for human society. Impacts
  include loss of livelihoods, food insecurity, changing infectious disease
  dynamics, and mental/emotional health impacts. Preventing biodiversity and
  ecosystem service loss leading to these outcomes is a grand challenge facing
  humankind. To adapt to and mitigate the consequences of climate change, we
  propose the CAMBIUM NRT to train a new scientific workforce with the data
  science skills to integrate disparate data streams and produce actionable
  results for decision-makers in industry and government. Existing graduate
  programs do not provide the combination of training in biodiversity data
  science and policy with an emphasis on transdisciplinary team-science
  training. CAMBIUM brings together scholars from diverse fields to develop a
  new graduate curriculum that provides a research and training environment to
  develop a new generation of scientists to use big data integration to address
  pressing challenges of biodiversity loss and societal well-being. Over the
  course of five years, CAMBIUM will award two-year fellowships to 18 fellows
  with additional 250 students participating in the program (~150 PhD and 100
  MS). Fellows and non-fellows will be able to apply for research and travel
  stipends for a total of 192 students funded through CAMBIUM. Keywords:

  Distributions; Food Security; Public Health; Track 1"
