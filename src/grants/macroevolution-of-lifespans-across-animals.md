grantDesc: . Decades of research have uncovered extensive variation in lifespans
  across the tree of life, yet the degree of variability in aging across
  organisms remains largely unquantified (Medawar, 1952). Similarly, there has
  not been a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of such variation across
  species (Li et al. 2023). In addition to the intrinsic importance of
  quantifying the variation and sources of variance in lifespan at different
  taxonomic levels, research around aging has been a central topic in medicine
  and related disciplines (e.g. Ruby et al. 2018). For instance, the extent to
  which aging can be modified in humans is still a matter of strong debate
  (Yamamoto et al. 2022). Yet a broader perspective on the evolution of aging is
  largely lacking. Is lifespan conserved across groups of organisms, or is it
  more labile? Do environmental and ecological features explain a significant
  fraction of the variance in lifespan across organisms? These and other
  questions could provide insights into the potential malleability of lifespan
  at smaller taxonomic scales. Fundamental mechanisms underlying the disparity
  in lifespans across species have been the focus of extensive research at
  microevolutionary scales (e.g., cells, individuals, populations; Williams
  1957). Research in this field has primarily concentrated on perspectives
  related to molecular evolution, including selection on deleterious alleles,
  purifying selection, mutation accumulation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and
  disposable soma. These perspectives on aging evolution have heavily relied on
  comparative genomic analysis. Contemporary studies have also shifted towards
  utilizing cell culture models to delineate genotype-phenotype interactions
  relevant to biological aging. However, these microevolutionary perspectives
  often lack a comprehensive understanding of the broader context surrounding
  lifespan evolution. The macroevolutionary perspective proposed in this project
  will enable the examination of patterns and trends across diverse taxonomic
  groups over extensive geological time scales.
