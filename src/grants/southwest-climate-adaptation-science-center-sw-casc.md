grantDesc: "Climate change is driving the emergence of disease as arthropod
  vectors track shifts  in temperature and precipitation. Tick-borne diseases
  have negative effects on humans and
  wildlife  in  North  America;  however,  the  presence  and  role  of  ticks  \
  in  arid  ecosystems  is  typically  underestimated.  One  new  parasite  of  \
  concern  in  Arizona  is  the  Gulf  Coast  tick  (Amblyomma  maculatum), a
  vector for a spotted fever rickettsiosis (caused by the bacteria Rickettsia
  parkeri).  The tick has only been recorded in Arizona since 2014, but it is
  unknown whether it previously  existed in this region and was undetected, or
  whether shifts in climate or habitat availability drove  its emergence. In
  2024, we conducted preliminary sampling for the Gulf Coast tick in SE
  Arizona.  We found that Gulf Coast ticks are widely distributed in this region
  and use a large range of
  bird  species  as  hosts.  In  partnership  with  land  managers,  public  he\
  alth  specialists,  and  avian  conservation biologists we propose to expand
  this project to further identify the factors that govern  the distribution of
  the tick and its bacteria and quantify their effects on avian hosts.  "
