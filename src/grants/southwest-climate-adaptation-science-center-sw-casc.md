grantName: Southwest Climate Adaptation Science Center (SW-CASC)
grantAmount: $438,945
grantDesc: The data collected through this project, made possible with the
  SW-CASC, will help determine whether changing climate, habitat loss, or bird
  dispersal is most likely behind the emergence of this tick in our region. We
  will use our results to predict where the tick will be found in the future as
  the climate changes and identify places where humans and other animals may be
  most at risk of contracting the disease. Our data will be used to inform
  management and conservation activities in the region and better understand the
  risk of emerging diseases to Arizona wildlife and people.
