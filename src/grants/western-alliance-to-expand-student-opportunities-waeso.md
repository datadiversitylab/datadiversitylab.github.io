grantName: "WAESO: Historical Biogeography and Extinction Risk Assessment of
  Recently Extinct Animals"
subawardAmount: ""
grantYears: "2024"
pi: Cristian Rom√°n-Palacios
grantAmount: $3,000
grantDesc: The WAESO grant funded a project that will allow for the
  visualization and reconstruction of historical landscapes and ranges of
  recently extinct species. This will enable students to learn about
  phylogenetic methods and expand on their comparative analysis skills to help
  identify distribution changes between extinct species and their sister taxa.
  The results of this research will aim to add to the global collaboration
  efforts on biodiversity conservation and action.
