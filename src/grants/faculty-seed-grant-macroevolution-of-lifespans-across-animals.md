grantName: "Faculty Seed Grant: Macroevolution of Lifespans Across Animals"
grantAmount: $15,000
grantDesc: Decades of research have uncovered extensive variation in lifespans
  across the tree of life, yet the degree of variability in aging across
  organisms remains largely unquantified (Medawar, 1952). Similarly, there has
  not been a comprehensive analysis of the drivers of such variation across
  species (Li et al. 2023). In addition to the intrinsic importance of
  quantifying the variation and sources of variance in lifespan at different
  taxonomic levels, research around aging has been a central topic in medicine
  and related disciplines (e.g. Ruby et al. 2018). For instance, the extent to
  which aging can be modified in humans is still a matter of strong debate
  (Yamamoto et al. 2022). Yet a broader perspective on the evolution of aging is
  largely lacking. Is lifespan conserved across groups of organisms, or is it
  more labile? Do environmental and ecological features explain a significant
  fraction of the variance in lifespan across organisms? These and other
  questions could provide insights into the potential malleability of lifespan
  at smaller taxonomic scales.
