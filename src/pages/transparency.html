                We value transparency and openness. In line with our dedication to cherish and expand these values to our community, we have dedicated this section of our website for the disclosing of salaries for most of the positions that the lab fills. We believe this not only fosters trust within our lab, but also does so for the community that we form part of, be it online, our institution, our city, state or country. By disclosing this information to the public we aim to show our community how their contributions (labor, taxes, donations, grants) are linked to effective research endeavors and responsible utilization of all the resources entrusted to us.
