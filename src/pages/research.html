We believe that diverse perspectives are an essential part of the drivers behind the research of the future. As a lab member, you will most likely actively participate in research that empowers diversity and inclusion efforts, making the potential for a stronger community a reality! Examples include focus on underserved and underrepresented student teaching and success, empowering them with tools necessary for the pervasive era of information! Additionally, with a lab focus on social justice, we aim to address social disparities through our interdisciplinary research approaches.  </p>
