        Dr. Cristian Román-Palacios serves as the Coordinator and Advisor for the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) and Master of Science in Information Science (MSIS) programs at the University of Arizona. The College of Information Science had 640 master’s students and 30 PhD students in the 2024-2025 school year and advising has been incredibly valuable. The advising team allows faculty to tailor their curriculum to fit the needs of both their students and the evolving needs of the industry to come.
