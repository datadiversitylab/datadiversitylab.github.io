            <p class="cs-text">
                There are two paths to postdoc opportunities in my lab. First, I have some funding to directly support a postdoc in my lab. Second, I can help you develop proposals for external fellowship support, such as the NSF postdoctoral research fellowships in biology (PRFB) which offers a $60,000/year stipend and $20,000/year research and training funds. I would be very excited to discuss research ideas with you for these opportunities.

            <h5 class="cs-title">Graduate students (admitted) </h5>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Opportunities for graduate students (MSc candidates or PhD candidates) to take payed positions in the lab in the form of Graduate Research Assistants or TAships (Teaching Assistant) can occasionally arise. These positions can run from 10-20Hrs a week and can cover partial tuition. Funding for these positions varies, but if interested we can always initiate a conversation in regards to applying for external funding and other opportunities together. For example, US students are eligible to apply for the NSF graduate research fellowship program (GRFP) which offers 5 years of support with an annual stipend of $37,000. I strongly encourage you to apply (if you're eligible) and I can help you develop proposals!

            <p class="cs-text">
                Interested in starting and completing a PhD with us? The iSchool offers opportunities to fund PhD students in the form of a multi-year stipend for living expenses and full tuition costs. Once admitted, projects will be defined with the PI.

            <h5 class="cs-title">Undergraduate students</h5>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Opportunities for undergraduate students to join the lab as undergraduate research assistants ocassionally arise. These positions usually are 10Hrs a week and payed at rates of 14.50-16/hr (2024-2025 rates) depending on experience. Ways in which students have gotten a position in the lab is by going through UArizona's VIP (Vertically Integrated Projects) initiative: https://uavip.arizona.edu/ . Student's who are eligible for Federal Work Study (FWS) and who are interested in our lab are encouraged to get in contact with the Data Diversity Lab's leaders for more information.
