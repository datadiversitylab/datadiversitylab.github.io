                Welcome to the teaching section at the Data Diversity Lab. Our commitment to teaching extends beyond the classroom, aiming to equip students with the tools to ask meaningful questions and navigate the complexities of scientific inquiry. In the courses that we teach, we go beyond the textbook, fostering an environment where students gain skills that transcend the boundaries of academia. We are primarily interested in implementing the following four key teaching principles in the classes that we are involved in:

                Below are the answers to three short questions from teaching course evaluations for multiple courses that Dr. Román-Palacios taught between 2016 (the first year in the US*) and 2019. No TCEs were available during 2020 due to the COVID pandemic. Only comments concerning Dr. Román-Palacios’ performance as an instructor are available. No comments were filtered out, and students' identities are completely anonymous, even to me! We will be curating TCEs for 2021+ in future years.
